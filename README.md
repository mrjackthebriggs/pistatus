# Raspberry Pi Status Indicator
This project used a arduino traffic light led pannel with a 10kOhm neutral return to a raspberry pi
This was used to monitor the status of my Raspberrypi 4b that I was using as a samba server and using with syncthing
Sometimes the server would go down, and due to the lack of signal lights on a raspberry pi, i engineered something up myself.
